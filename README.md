## Projects

1. **mad_libs.py**  
   A fun word game where you provide words to fill in the blanks, creating humorous and random stories.

2. **guess_the_num.py**  
   A number guessing game where the computer picks a 3-digit number with unique digits, and you try to guess it with hints given after each attempt.

3. **dice_roll.py**  
   Simulates rolling six-sided dice. Enter the number of dice to roll, and see random results. Type "exit" to quit the game.

4. **hangman.py**
   This is a simple implementation of the classic hangman game. The player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word chosen at random. They have a limited number of tries before the game ends.

5. **password_gen.py**
   This script generates secure random passwords based on user preferences. It supports options for including uppercase letters and symbols.

6. **rock_paper_scissors.py**
   This script allows a user to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. It keeps track of wins, losses, and ties until the user exits the game.

7. **QR_Code_gen**
   This script defines a class `GenerateQR` that can generate and save QR codes based on user input. Users can specify QR code size, padding, and color settings.

   Dependencies to install: qrcode, Pillow

8. **Website_checker**
   This script reads a CSV of website URLs, checks their HTTP status by sending a GET request, and prints a description of the response (e.g., OK, Not Found). It ensures all URLs are properly formatted with 'https://', and uses a random Firefox user agent for the requests.

9. **Password_checker**
   This script checks how common a given password is by comparing it against a list of common passwords. It reads a file containing popular passwords and returns the rank of the password if it matches, or informs the user that the password seems unique if no match is found. The script ensures the user enters a valid, non-empty password.
